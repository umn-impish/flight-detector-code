== Detector Commands | IMPRESS/EXACT/IMPISH ==

All commands listed in this document may be sent to the IMPRESS/EXACT/IMPISH
flight controller code via UDP.
Each command responds with either "ack-ok\nmessage" or "error\nmessage".
If an error occurs you may check the systemd logs for more details.


terminate
    Kills the process.


init
    Initializes the detectors (USB + settings send/recv) and connects to them.
    More technically, this creates a DetectorService object and starts its event loop
    in a worker thread.
    Command assumes all desired detectors are powered.


shutdown
    Deletes worker thread and deletes detector service.
    Even though the service is deleted,
    the socket to listen for commands is still open.


start-nominal
    Starts nominal data collection.
    In the case of IMPRESS, this starts time slice acquisitions and
    enables the X-123 hardware-buffered acquisitions.
    In the case of EXACT, starts list mode acquisitions.


stop-nominal
    Stops the nominal data collection.
    Same effect for EXACT and IMPRESS.


manual-health
    Request a health packet from the detector process manually.
    It gets sent back to the requester ip address.


start-periodic-health seconds_between address1 [address2] ... [addressN]
    Tell the detector process to periodically send out health packets.
    Can be sent to arbitrary # of addresses specified in the command.
    Parameters:
        seconds_between: time to wait between sending out health packets
        address 1...N: addresses to send the health packets to. at least one is required.


stop-periodic-health
    Tell the detector process to stop sending out its health data.
    Erases previous forwarding addresses.


settings-update [detector] . . .
    Modify detector settings (custom ones and "built-in" ones).
    -- NOTE --.
        The MCAC=[bins]; option needs to be set in X-123 ascii_settings for the DetectorService to work.
        Custom settings (adc_rebin_edges and ack_err_retries) also need to be set for the service
        to function properly.
        This is because these values are used in either requesting spectra (MCAC for # of bins
        to request, and ack_err_retries to know when to throw an error and not retry),
        or, processing the spectra afterwards (rebbinning them).

    For Bridgeport detectors, you can select them like this:
        settings-update hafx c1 ...
        settings-update hafx m1 ...
        settings-update hafx m5 ...
        settings-update hafx x1 ...
            Here "..." can be any one of the following:
            adc_rebin_edges
                Custom edges we send to each detector for the 123 ADC bins.
                Maps from the 4096 native Bridgeport bins to the 123 time_slice bins.
                Format described in firmware document.
            fpga_ctrl
                fpga_ctrl registers (Bridgeport)
            arm_ctrl
                arm_ctrl registers (Bridgeport)
            arm_cal
                arm_cal registers (Bridgeport)
            fpga_weights
                fpga_weights registers (Bridgeport)

        Example:
        settings-update hafx c1 adc_rebin_edges 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 5 5 5 ... 127

    For the X-123 you select it like this:
        settings-update x123 [options ...]
            Valid [options ...]:
            ascii_settings [string to write]
                These are the "built-in" X-123 settings that Amptek provides.
                The "string to write" format should follow the Amptek format like this:
                    `settings-update x123 ascii_settings MCAC=256;OTHER=blah;DINGUS=bingus;`

            adc_rebin_edges [edge 1] [edge 2] ... [edge N]
                We want to be able to rebin our X-123 spectrum down adaptively.
                This should be an array of ADC bin edges to bin down the nominal X-123 spectrum
                to a smaller value.
                    example:
                    `settings-update x123 adc_rebin_edges 0 512 1024`
                The above example rebins the x-123 spectrum to three very big
                bins, assuming at least a 1024 bin spectrum acquisition.

            ack_err_retries [retries_val]
                If we get an "ACK ERROR" packet from the X-123, we want to
                retry a couple times before giving up.
                This parameter enables this.


debug [detector] [options...]
    Request a "debug" acquisition for a particular detector.
    This could be querying a particular setting or set of settings,
    or a histogram or list mode acquisition.

    Bridgeport format:
        debug hafx [channel] [operation] (wait_time)
        channel
            HaFX channel to operate on: c1, m1, m5, x1

        operation
            What to debug. Valid are:
                arm_ctrl
                arm_cal
                arm_status
                fpga_ctrl
                fpga_statistics
                fpga_weights
                histogram
                time_slice
                list_mode
                nrl_list_mode

        wait_time
            Only used for the following oprerations:
                - histogram
                - list_mode
                - nrl_list_mode
                - time_slice
            Units: seconds.
            Says how long to wait before polling the detector after
            starting data acquisition.
            Max value: 3600s (one hour)
            Min value: 1s

    X123 format:
        debug x123 [operation] (operation params)
        operation
            What to query from the X-123. Valid are:
                histogram
                diagnostic
                ascii_settings

        (operation params)
            Only ascii_settings and histogram have these options.
            These vary depending on the type.
            Examples:
                Debug a histogram with a 55s collection time
                    debug x123 histogram 55
                Query the MCAC (# of bins used by the Multi-Channel Analyzer [MCA]) setting from the X-123
                    debug x123 ascii_settings MCAC=;
